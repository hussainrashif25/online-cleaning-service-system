# online-cleaning-service-system
A school project to create a "Software as a Service" website for customers looking to hire cleaners. The website is created with Express.js, Handlebars.js and MongoDB for the database. The site allows for "Customers" and "Workers" to register, login, hire/deny service, withdraw payments and search for workers.
